# Testing 
## Reads Synthesizer
Input for the tests. <br>
- Synthetic reads from genomes ("exact matches"), with same length and position as the "windows" splitting of the genomes, or arbitrary slices of the genomes. <br>
- Same, with added errors (simulating nanopore errors) 
- Nanopore isolate reads (real reads)

## Binning
Binning of reads according to the clusters

## Classification
Classification by Kraken2 (later by Centrifuge and other classifiers)

## Visualization and metrics
To be done to check the accuracy, compared to no binning.
